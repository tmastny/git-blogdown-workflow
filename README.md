# git-blogdown-workflow

This repo is used in my blog post "Use git to Blog(down) About Your Projects":

https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/git-blogdown-projects-workflow/

The idea is I often have personal projects that I would like to blog about. And I'd like to reuse as much of the data and analysis is possible, instead of copy/pasting just for the post. So this repo is setup as an example project, and the blog post is about how to reuse these files and data for the blog.
